## Abstract
Time series forecasting is a crucial capability for many real-world decision-making processes. Modern statistical and machine learning approaches offer viable and accurate methodologies for time series prediction tasks. This report provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of both classical machine learning and deep neural network architectures on time series forecasting. Six machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression, random forest regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, as well as three deep neural network architectures, specifically multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRU), are analyzed. These models encompass both traditional and leading-edge techniques for modeling time-sequenced data. We conduct a comparative evaluation of predictive accuracy and computational performance on the "Walmart recruiting - store sales forecasting" dataset and examine predictive accuracy and computational efficiency to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the examined predictive models. The key results indicate that ensemble tree-based methods and long short-term neural architectures achieve top performance. Overall, the empirical insights construct a comprehensive applied perspective on leveraging statistical and deep learning methodologies for data-driven time series prediction.
